# Unlisted analysis

![waterfall](./waterfall22356x3000.png)

This is an analysis of SponsorBlock [`unlistedvideos.csv`](https://sponsor.ajay.app/database) which submissions range from 2021-06-24 to 2021-07-29 (I am scared).

## Why?

Boredom will kill, and finding gold is fun.

## Whats included?

- [`process.js`](./process.js) takes in `unlistedVideos.csv` and (slowly[^4]) spits out an enriched version...
  - [`processedUnlisted.csv`](./processedUnlisted.csv) - which adds the title, tags and category (also dosent include private/removed videos).
- [`sort.js`](./sort.js) takes in the previously generated `processedUnlisted.csv` and (would you know it) sorts it into...
  - [`rawsort.json`](./rawsort.json) - a cache (use with `--cache` flag).[^3]
  - [`chnLb.txt`](./chnLb.txt) - a human friendly table consistin of a channel name, unlisted video count and unlisted video ids.
  - [`tagLb.txt`](./tagsLb.txt) - most used tags.
  - [`catLb.txt`](./catLb.txt) - most used categories.
  - [`wordLb.txt`](./wordLb.txt) - most used words in titles[^1]. (Min word length is 3)
  - [`chnTagsLb.txt`](./chnTagsLb.txt) - most used tags on a channel.
- [`filter.js`](./filter.js) filters `processedUnlisted.csv`. use `-h` flag for help.
  - `--overview` generates an `overview.md`[^6]
- [`playlist.js`](./playlist.js) - generates a youtube playlist to make your viewing experience just a bit better (read the top of the file for instructions)
  - [my attempt](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9PJbB19jd9UIZuXt2YSbGWhwxSVDVUto) since you can only add ~200 videos a day
- [`waterfall.js`](./waterfall.js) - used to generate the image above. `-h`

## Results

From 121,403 videos to 35,797 (thats ~30%).

### [`wordLb.txt`](./wordLb.txt)[^5]

Most of the top words are conjunctions or articles.
